title: Permitting Initiative
summary: "Most people agree that Austin is\_[the best place to live in the United States](http://realestate.usnews.com/places/rankings/best-places-to-live). Between Barton Springs, The University of Texas, and great queso, it’s hard to argue otherwise.\n\nWith all that love and attention comes growth.\_[The City of Austin](https://austintexas.gov/)\_works to ensure safe and sustainable development through a process of permitting and building inspections. In facilitating and regulating residential projects, the city also wants to help the people who live here participate in the city’s development and realize their home projects.\n\nTo make the permitting process more accessible and cohesive,\_[The Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellows](https://cityofaustin.github.io/innovation-fellows/)\_are teaming up with the\_[Development Services Department](http://austintexas.gov/department/development-services)\_to rethink the ways in which the public and city work together. Here’s a look at what we’re up to with The Permitting Initiative."
